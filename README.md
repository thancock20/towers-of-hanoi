#  Towers of Hanoi

Towers of Hanoi solver.
Live site is [here](http://www.toddhancock.net/towers-of-hanoi).

The heart of this app is the `hanoi` generator function, found in `src/hanoi.js`. See also, [this gist](https://gist.github.com/thancock20/99b90a67d58308ae83d7054742d09296).

I'm sure the UX could definitely use some work.
